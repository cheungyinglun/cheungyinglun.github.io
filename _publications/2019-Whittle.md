We consider six variants of (local) Whittle estimators of the fractional order of integration d. They follow a limiting normal distribution under stationarity as well as under (a certain degree of) nonstationarity. Experimentally, we observe a lack of continuity of the objective functions of the two fully extended versions at d=1/2 that has not been reported before. It results in a pileup of the estimates at d=1/2 when the true value is in a neighborhood to this half point. Consequently, studentized test statistics may be heavily oversized. The other four versions suffer from size distortions, too, although of a different pattern and to a different extent.
