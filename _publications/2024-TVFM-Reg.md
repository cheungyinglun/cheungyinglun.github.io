Time-varying factor models have gained much popularity in recent years. However, the newly developed local estimator is susceptible to a time-varying rotation matrix that may exhibit jumps. This letter proposes a simple method to avoid the jumps. We show by simulations that the proposed procedure can effectively eliminate jumps in the rotation matrix, leading to a substantially lower mean-square forecasting error.
